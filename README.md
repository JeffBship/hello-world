### How Does it Work?
The GrovePi board slips over the Raspberry Pi.  Connect the Grove Sensors to the GrovePi board.  Upload your program.  Begin taking in the worlds data!

### Raspberry Pi Compatibility
The GrovePi is compatible with the Raspberry Pi models A, A+, B, B+, 2, and 3.

### Getting Started
Getting started is easy. Check out our Getting Started With GrovePi Guide [here](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/get-started-with-the-grovepi/). 
We have an extensive library that covers most Grove sensors. You can find it on the Github repo.  You wonâ€™t need to hack much at all with our library: get started coding in Python and C now! 

### ButtonRotaryDemo.java

ButtonRotaryDemo provides an example of a client class interacting with the observer package.  For each sensor that is desired,
the developer must create an implementation of an invoker interface (either implements ButtonInvoker or implements RotaryInvoker).
Within the newly created class include the code for the action desired for any of the button/rotary events.





### Credits
