This is a java interface for usage with the button device that connects to
the Raspberry Pi.  It follows a state design pattern and is customizable for most  desired uses.

NOTE: StateA.java, StateB.java, StateC.java, and ButtonAContext.java are samples of how to utilize the abstract class and interface provided. StateDemo.java demonstrates a way to implement this.

Update notes will be included in this ReadMe file for easy reference.

**11/15/17 Update**
- Renamed StateTester class to StateDemo to more accurately indicate that this is a demonstration of how the provided State pattern can be implemented.
- Changed ButtonContext.buttonState visibility to protected and removed redundant class variable ButtonAContext.buttonState.
- Provided default functionality in ButtonContext methods and removed abstract designation.
- Updated javadoc and readme to reflect these changes.

Made changes per feedback:
- Created source folder structure to reflect package structure.
