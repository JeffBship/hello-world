### Work in Progress:  
This readme is NOT a final version.  Posting to see the formats.

### ButtonRotaryDemo.java

ButtonRotaryDemo provides an example of a client class interacting with the observer package.  For each sensor that is desired,
the developer must create an implementation of an invoker interface (either implements ButtonInvoker or implements RotaryInvoker).
Within the newly created class include the code for the action desired for any of the button/rotary events.




### Package grovepi.observer

This package provides the tools used to create the invokers.  . 

ButtonInvoker: Declares the methods that are called when ButtonPressDistinguisher identifies a single, double, and long press respectively.

ButtonPressDistinguisher (implements InputSensorObserver): Recieves updates containing sensor events, analyzes the timing of these events and invokes the appropriate method on this instance's ButtonInvoker object.

InputSensorObserver: Provides the interface that all concrete InputSensorObservers must implement.

InputSensorReader: Provides a common set of control methods and class variables for subclasses.
DigitalInputReader (extends InputSensorReader): Reads sensor data from a GrovePi digital sensor and updates an observed with this data.
AnalogInputReader (extends InputSensorReader):  An instance of this class reads sensor data from a GrovePi analog sensor and updates an observer with this data.


RotaryAngleDeterminer (implements InputSensorObserver):
